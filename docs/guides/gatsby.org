#+jsx: <Notice title="DEPRECATED">I'm no longer actively maintaining this Gatsby integration due to the rapid pace of frontend development. However, the source code remains available for those who wish to adapt and maintain it independently. You can refer to the orgajs project for examples of advanced usage.</Notice>

* Create Gatsby Project

Create a new gatsby website following the [[https://www.gatsbyjs.com/get-started/][documentation]]. Or simply

#+begin_src sh
npx gatsby new gatsby-site
#+end_src

* Installation

Install packages.

#+begin_src sh
cd gatsby-site
yarn add gatsby-plugin-orga @orgajs/react @orgajs/loader
#+end_src

* Configuration

Add =gatsby-plugin-orga= to =gatsby-config.js=.

#+begin_src javascript
module.exports = {
  plugins: ['gatsby-plugin-orga']
}
#+end_src

Add a org file in folder =src/pages= directory. It should work out of the box.

For more advanced usage, please checkout code of [[https://github.com/orgapp/orgajs][orgajs project]], which generate this website via =gatsby-theme-orga-docs=.
